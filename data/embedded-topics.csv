@OverloadMusic wish me luck!!! I'm getting my HPV jabs tomorrow
I got the final HPV shot today which is so pointless bc I already have it
I just got my hpv vaccine and it hurt sooo bad my arm's so sad
@hayesy316  He stated ‚ÄúI won't be rushing out to get my daughters vaccinated [for cervical cancer], "  that's not about 'men also'
@DHgovuk Must to revise their heteronormative health policy. Vicarious immunisation of HPV doesnt work for men who don't sleep with women.
I need some prayers up for my older sister Shalice Taylor. She has stage three cervical cancer. I've known for awhile now.
What the fuck is a hpv shot?
Ofcourse I say yes to getting the hpv vaccine now I'm gonna be here forever god damnit
